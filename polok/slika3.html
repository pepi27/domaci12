Full Fathom Five is one of the earliest masterpieces of Pollock's drip technique. The actual origins and initial development of this
technique have never been fully explained, except by reading back from fuller photographic evidence produced about 1950, two or three years
after this work was painted. Like other practical breakthroughs in twentieth-century painting, 'creative accident' seems likely to have
played an important part, as Pollock probed and tested methods of paint application which promote the continuousness of line rather
than the broken lines inevitable in the constant reloadings and readjustments of conventional brushwork. His solution was to pour
from a can of domestic paint along a stick resting inside the container, so that a constant 'beam' of pigment came into contact
with the canvas (which he left unstretched on the studio floor). The character of the line was determined by certain physical
and material variables that could be combined in almost infinite permutations: the viscosity of the paint (controlled by
thinning and dilution); the angle and hence speed of the pouring; and the dynamics of Pollock's bodily gestures, his sweep
and rhythm, especially in the wrist, arm and shoulder. 'Like a seismograph', noted writer Wemer Haftmann 'the painting recorded
the energies and states of the man who drew it.' In addition Pollock would flick, splatter and dab subsidiary colors on to the
dominant linear configuration.
